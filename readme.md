# Brigham & Women's Hospital Navigation and Service Request Platform

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the CS3733 Software Engineering course at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in collaboration with Brigham & Women’s Hospital. The goal was to prototype a robust, full-stack web application to improve internal hospital navigation and streamline staff service requests.

The application supports interactive building navigation, map editing, and dynamic service request workflows tailored to hospital staff needs. It is designed for scalability, modularity, and full cloud deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn/UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (hosted on AWS RDS)
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS EC2
- **Other Tools**: GitHub Projects, Postman, Figma

## My Role

I was the **Lead Full-Stack Senior Software Engineer** on a 10-person Agile development team. My responsibilities included:

- Leading architectural decisions and mentoring team members across the stack
- Developing major platform features, including:
  - Interactive pathfinding engine for hospital navigation
  - Custom map editor with real-time node/edge manipulation
  - Voice-activated user interface for hands-free interaction
  - Auto node and edge generator that integrates with a floor plan image to rapidly build navigable graphs
  - Modular service request creation system for hospital staff needs
- Writing and managing user stories and diagrams (use case, class, sequence, activity)
- Overseeing schema design, backend logic, and RESTful API integration
- Managing cloud deployment with Docker and AWS

## Features

- 🗺️ Pathfinding across and within hospital buildings
- 🧭 Real-time map editor with node and edge creation tools
- 🧠 **Auto node and edge generator** – upload a floor plan image and automatically generate the internal graph structure for integration
- 📋 Modular service request workflows (e.g., maintenance, transport, cleaning)
- 🎙️ Voice-controlled user interface
- ☁️ Fully deployed using Docker and AWS infrastructure

## Outcome

Our team successfully delivered a robust prototype within a five-week sprint-based development cycle. The final application met Brigham & Women’s Hospital's requirements and served as a strong foundation for potential real-world deployment.
